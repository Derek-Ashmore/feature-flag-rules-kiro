# Technology Stack

## Development Environment
- **IDE**: Kiro IDE with MCP (Model Context Protocol) enabled
- **Platform**: Cross-platform development
- **License**: MIT License

## Project Configuration
- **VS Code Integration**: Configured with Kiro agent MCP support
- **Version Control**: Git repository

## Development Workflow
Since this is an early-stage project demonstrating spec-driven development:

### Spec-First Approach
1. Create specifications before implementation
2. Define clear input/output contracts
3. Ensure testable behavior through specs

### Common Commands
*Note: Build system and testing framework to be determined based on chosen technology stack*

Future considerations for tech stack selection:
- Language choice (JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Go, etc.)
- Testing framework
- Build/packaging system
- Deployment strategy
