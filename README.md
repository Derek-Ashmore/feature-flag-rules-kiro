# feature-flag-rules-kiro
Feature flag rules engine to illustrate spec-driven development using Kiro.

## Overview

This project demonstrates spec-driven development using the [Kiro](https://kiro.dev/) IDE. All features are specified before implementation, ensuring clear requirements and testable behavior.

## What it is
A minimal feature flag evaluator.

> Initial implementation

* Input: {userId, region, plan}
* Return enabled features
* Rules are static (e.g., Pro users get Feature X)
